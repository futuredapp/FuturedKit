/// A model representation of an alert, which is used by `defaultAlert(model: AlertModel)` SwiftUI View modifier
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// It wraps the native `alert(_:isPresented:presenting:actions:message:)`, but you show an alert in different way by using the `defaultAlert(model:)` view modifier,
/// which then appears whenever the bound `model` value is not `nil` value.
/// Alert model contains two actions: `primaryAction` and `secondaryAction`, which are then represented as SwiftUI Button
/// If both values are nil, system presents alert with standard "OK" button and given `title` and `message`
/// If one of the actions contains `destructive` button role and there is no `cancel` button role, system will add standard button with "Cancel" title.
/// If both `primaryAction` and `secondaryAction` actions have `destructive` button roles, system will still add standard "Cancel" button to the alert.
///
/// In the following example, a button presents a simple alert when tapped, by updating a local `alertModel` property.
/// Alert contains given `title` and `message` with standard "OK" button
///
/// ```swift
/// @State private var alertModel: AlertModel?
/// var body: some View {
///     Button("Tap to show alert") {
///         alertModel = AlertModel(
///             title: "Current Location Not Available",
///             message: "Your current location can’t be determined at this time."
///         )
///     }
///     .defaultAlert(model: $alertModel)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following example adds primary “Delete” button with `destructive` button role and standard "Cancel" button which is added by system.
///
/// ```swift
/// @State private var alertModel: AlertModel?
/// var body: some View {
///     Button("Tap to show alert") {
///         alertModel = AlertModel(
///             title: "Unable to Save Workout Data",
///             message: "The connection to the server was lost.",
///             primaryAction: AlertModel.ButtonAction(
///                 title: "Delete,
///                 buttonRole: .destructive,
///                 action: deleteWorkoutData
///             )
///         )
///     }
///     .defaultAlert(model: $alertModel)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The alert handles its own dismissal when the user taps one of the buttons in the alert,
/// by setting the bound `model` value back to `nil`.
